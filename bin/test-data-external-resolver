# This is a test external resolver that always returns the same resolved information for every request.
# It can be used in local development to test how Swift-DocC interacts with information from an external source.
#
# To set this up, set the `DOCC_LINK_RESOLVER_EXECUTABLE` environmental variable to the path of this script.
#
# Swift-DocC will call this executable for unresolved symbol references in the processed symbol graph files and for
# absolute documentation links with the "com.test.bundle" identifier. For example: <doc://com.test.bundle/something>
