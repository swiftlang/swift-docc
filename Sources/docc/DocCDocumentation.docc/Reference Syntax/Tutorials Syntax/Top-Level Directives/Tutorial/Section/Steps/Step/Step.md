    @Tutorial(time: 30) {
        @Intro(title: "Creating Custom Sloths") {
            
            ...

        }
        
        @Section(title: "Create a new folder and add SlothCreator") {
            @ContentAndMedia {
                
                ...
                
            }
            
            @Steps {
                @Step {
                    Create the folder.
                    
                    @Image(source: placeholder-image, alt: "A screenshot using the `mkdir` command to create a folder to place SlothCreator in.")
                }
                
                ...
                                
            }
        }

    The following steps display your customized sloth view in the preview.

    @Step {
        Add the `sloth` parameter to initialize the `CustomizedSlothView` in the preview provider, and pass a new `Sloth` instance for the value.
        
        @Code(name: "CustomizedSlothView.swift", file: 01-creating-code-02-07.swift) {
            @Image(source: preview-01-creating-code-02-07.png, alt: "A portrait of a generic sloth displayed in the center of the canvas.")
        }
