# Documenting a Swift Framework or Package

Create developer documentation from in-source comments, add articles with code snippets, 
and add tutorials for a guided learning experience.

## Overview

DocC, or _Documentation Compiler_, makes it easy to produce 
rich and engaging developer documentation for your Swift frameworks and packages. 
The compiler builds documentation by combining in-source comments with extension files, 
articles, and other resources, 
allowing you to create rich and engaging documentation for developers.

With DocC, you provide a combination of reference and conceptual content, and 
connect it together using powerful organization and linking capabilities. Because you write 
documentation directly in source, you can use the tools you're already familiar 
with, like Git, to track changes.

### Build Simple Documentation from Your Source Comments

For DocC to compile your documentation, the Swift compiler first builds your Swift framework 
or package, and stores additional information about its public APIs alongside 
the compiled artifacts. DocC consumes that information and compiles the documentation into a DocC Archive. This process repeats for every Swift framework or package your target depends on.

To build documentation for your Swift framework or package, use the DocC command-line interface in preview mode and specify a location. On macOS, DocC monitors the files in the location and recompiles when you make changes. On other platforms, you need to quit and restart DocC to recompile the documentation.

> Tip: You can also use the Swift-DocC Plugin to [build a documentation archive for a Swift package][plugin-docs].

[plugin-docs]: https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/generating-documentation-for-hosting-online/

DocC uses the comments you write in your source code as the content for the 
documentation pages it generates. At a minimum, add basic documentation 
comments to the framework's public symbols so that DocC can use this information as the symbols'
single-sentence abstracts or summaries.

Alternatively, add thorough documentation comments to provide further detail, including
 information about parameters, return values, and errors. For more information, see 
<doc:writing-symbol-documentation-in-your-source-files>.

### Configure a Richer Documentation Experience

By default, DocC compiles only in-source symbol documentation and then 
groups those symbols together by their kind, such as protocols, classes, 
enumerations, and so forth. When you want to provide additional content or 
customize the organization of symbols, use a documentation 
catalog.

DocC combines the public API information from the Swift compiler with the 
contents of the documentation catalog to generate a much richer DocC Archive.

Use a documentation catalog when you want to include any of the following:

* A landing page that introduces a framework and arranges its top-level 
symbols, as well as extension files that provide custom organization for the 
symbols' properties and methods. For more information, see 
<doc:adding-structure-to-your-documentation-pages>.
* Extension files that supplement in-source comments, and articles that 
provide supporting conceptual content. For more information, see 
<doc:adding-supplemental-content-to-a-documentation-catalog>.
* Tutorials that teach developers APIs through 
step-by-step, interactive content. For more information, see 
<doc:building-an-interactive-tutorial>.
* Resource files to use in your documentation, like images and videos.

> Important: To use a documentation catalog in a Swift package, make sure the 
manifest's Swift tools version is set to `5.5` or later. 

## Building, Publishing, and Previewing Documentation with the DocC Plug-in

The preferred way of building documentation for your Swift package is by using
the Swift-DocC Plugin. Refer to instructions in the plugin's 
[documentation](https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/)
to get startedÂ with [building](https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/generating-documentation-for-a-specific-target), [previewing](https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/previewing-documentation),
and publishing your documentation to your [website](https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/generating-documentation-for-hosting-online) or [GitHub Pages](https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/publishing-to-github-pages).

You can also use the DocC command-line interface, as described in <doc:distributing-documentation-to-other-developers>.
