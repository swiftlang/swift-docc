# Customizing the Appearance of Your Documentation Pages

Customize the look and feel of your documentation webpages.

## Overview

By default, rendered documentation webpages produced by DocC come with a default
visual styling. If you wish, you may make adjustments to this styling by adding
an optional `theme-settings.json` file to the root of your documentation catalog
with some configuration. This file is used to customize various things like
colors and fonts. You can even make changes to the way that specific elements
appear, like buttons, code listings, and asides. Additionally, some metadata for
the website can be configured in this file, and it can also be used to opt in or
opt out of certain default rendering behavior.

If you're curious about the full capabilities of the `theme-settings.json` file,
you can check out the latest Open API specification for it [here][1], which
documents all valid settings that could be present.

Let's walk through some basic examples of customizing the appearance of
documentation now.

### Colors

DocC utilizes [CSS custom properties][2] (CSS variables) to define the various
colors that are used throughout the HTML elements of rendered documentation. Any
key/value in the `theme.color` object of `theme-settings.json` will either
update an existing color property used in the renderer or add a new one that
could be referenced by existing ones.

**Example**

As a simple example, the following configuration would update the background
fill color for the "documentation intro" element to `"rebeccapurple"` by
changing the value of the CSS property to `--color-documentation-intro-fill:
"rebeccapurple"`.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "color": {
      "documentation-intro-fill": "rebeccapurple"
    }
  }
}
```

**Example**

Note that any valid CSS color value could be used. Here is a more advanced
example which demonstrates how specialized dark and light versions of the main
background fill and nav colors could be defined as varying lightness percentages
of a green hue.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "color": {
      "hue-green": "120",
      "fill": {
        "dark": "hsl(var(--color-hue-green), 100%, 10%)",
        "light": "hsl(var(--color-hue-green), 100%, 90%)"
      },
      "fill-secondary": {
        "dark": "hsl(var(--color-hue-green), 100%, 20%)",
        "light": "hsl(var(--color-hue-green), 100%, 80%)"
      },
      "nav-solid-background": "var(--color-fill)"
    }
  }
}
```

As a general rule, the default color properties provided by DocC assumes a
naming convention where "fill" colors are used for backgrounds and "figure"
colors are used for foreground colors, like text. Note that colors defined in 
`theme-settings.json` will be used across all pages of your documentation bundle.

### Fonts

By default, there are two main fonts used by DocC: one for monospaced text in
code voice and another for all other text content. With `theme-settings.json`,
you can customize the CSS `font-family` lists for these however you choose.

**Example**

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "typography": {
      "html-font": "\"Comic Sans MS\", \"Comic Sans\", cursive",
      "html-font-mono": "\"Courier New\", Courier, monospace"
    }
  }
}
```

### Borders

Another aspect of the renderer that you may wish to modify is the way that it
applies border to certain elements. With `theme-settings.json`, you can change
the default border radius for all elements and also individually update the
border styles for asides, buttons, code listings, and tutorial steps.

**Example**

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "aside": {
      "border-radius": "6px",
      "border-style": "double",
      "border-width": "3px"
    },
    "border-radius": "0",
    "button": {
      "border-radius": "8px",
      "border-style": "solid",
      "border-width": "2px"
    },
    "code": {
      "border-radius": "2px",
      "border-style": "dashed",
      "border-width": "2px"
    },
    "tutorial-step": {
      "border-radius": "12px"
    }
  }
}
```

### Icons

It is also possible to use `theme-settings.json` to specify custom icons to use
in place of the default ones provided by DocC. There are a few basic steps to
follow in order to override an icon:

1. Find the identifier that maps to the icon you want to override.
2. Add this value as an `id` attribute to the new SVG icon.
3. Associate a relative or absolute URL to the new SVG icon with the identifier
   in `theme-settings.json`.

> Note:
> You can find all the possible identifier values for every valid icon kind in
> the Open API [specification][1] for `theme-settings.json`.

**Example**

As a simple example, here is how you could update the icon used for articles in
the sidebar to be a simple box:

1. Find the identifier for article icons: `"article"`
2. Add the `id="article"` attribute to the new SVG icon: `simple-box.svg`
    ```svg
    <svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="article">
      <rect x="2" y="2" width="10" height="10" stroke="currentColor" fill="none"></rect>
    </svg>
    ```
3. Configure `theme-settings.json` to map the URL for the new article icon
    ```json
    {
      "theme": {
        "icons": {
          "article": "/images/simple-box.svg"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

articles](theme-screenshot-08.png)

### Metadata

You can specify some text that will be used in the HTML `<title>` element for
all webpages in `theme-settings.json` in place of the default "Documentation"
text.

**Example**

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "title": "Custom Title",
  }
}
```

With that configuration, the title of this page would change from "Customizing
Your Documentation Appearance | Documentation" to "Customizing Your Documentation
Appearance | **Custom Title**".

### Feature Flags

From time to time, there may be instances of various experimental UI features
that can be enabled or disabled using `theme-settings.json`.

**Example**

If you want to disable the OnThisPageNav right side navigation, you can set the
`features.docs.onThisPageNavigator.disable` to `true`.

Note that some of these flags may be dropped in the future and new ones may
be added as necessary for other features.

```json
{
  "features": {
    "docs": {
      "quickNavigation": {
        "enable": true
      }, 
      "onThisPageNavigator": {
        "disable": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Customizing the appearance of specific pages

Aside from the customizations available via `theme-settings.json`, Swift DocC
provides several <doc:Metadata> directives that allow you to customize just
one specific Article page.

Most notably:
- ``PageImage`` allows you to set a header image of a page.
- ``PageColor`` allows you to set an accent color of a page.
