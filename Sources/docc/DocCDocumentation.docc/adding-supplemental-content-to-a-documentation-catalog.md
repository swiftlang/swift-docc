# Adding Supplemental Content to a Documentation Catalog

Include articles and extension files to extend your source documentation comments or provide supporting conceptual content.

## Overview

A documentation catalog (a directory with a '.docc' extension) contains files that enrich your source documentation
comments. Two types of files that documentation catalogs can contain are
articles and extension files.

Typically, documentation comments in source code describe how specific APIs
work, but often don't explain how all the pieces in a project fit together at a
conceptual level. Adding an article to your documentation catalog is one way to
include this conceptual content. Articles are markup files that contain
information that doesn't relate to a specific symbol. Use articles to:

* Provide a landing page that includes an overview of your package or framework
* Craft a learning path for readers to understand how to use your project, such
  as with a getting started guide or a tutorial
  
Extension files are markup files that complement source documentation
 comments. Use extension files to:

* Organize properties and methods that a symbol contains
* Provide additional content beyond source documentation comments
* Override source documentation comments

For details about adding a landing page and organizing symbols using extension
files, see
<doc:adding-structure-to-your-documentation-pages>.

The process of crafting great documentation is an art. Your
content is unique; you know which elements, beyond source
documentation comments, provide the most value to your readers. For 
information about adding documentation to your project and creating a
documentation catalog, see
<doc:documenting-a-swift-framework-or-package>.

### Add Articles to Explain Concepts or Describe Tasks

Adding articles to your documentation catalog helps readers understand how
the types and methods in your project work as a system. They let you
explain how to complete a task, or discuss a broader concept that doesn't fit
into an Overview section for a specific symbol.

The structure of an article is similar to symbol files or a top-level landing
page, with the exception that the first level 1 header is regular content instead
of a symbol reference. For example, the Getting Started with Sloths article
contains the following title, single-sentence abstract or summary, and Overview section:

```markdown
# Getting Started with Sloths

Create a sloth and assign personality traits and abilities.

## Overview

Sloths are complex creatures that require careful creation and a suitable
habitat.
...
```

To add an article to your documentation catalog, use a text editor and create a
file with an appropriate title and add an `.md` extension.

> Important:
> DocC uses the article's lowercased file name, with consecutive
> sequences of whitespace and punctuation replaced with a hyphen (`-`), as a
> path component in the URL for that page.
>
> If two or more articles have the same file name, DocC will raise a warning
> and skip building documentation for all but one of those articles.
>
> DocC doesn't display the article file name in content. Instead, it uses the
> title from the level 1 header in places where the article is referenced.

After the Overview section, additional sections and subsections use a double
hash (##) for a level 2 header, and a triple hash (###) for a level 3 header.
Follow the hashes with a space, and then the title for that section or
subsection.

> Tip: To help readers perform a specific task, use sections to guide them
  through the steps necessary to complete the task. For larger concepts, consider
  adding a series of articles that build on each other.

When you add an article to a documentation catalog, DocC includes a link to it
on the project's top-level page. To choose a different location for the
article, add a link to it from a group or collection. When DocC renders a link to
 an article, it uses the article's title for the text of the link. For more information
about organizing your project's documentation, see
<doc:adding-structure-to-your-documentation-pages>. 
 
### Add Extension Files to Append to or Override Source Documentation Comments

Although writing documentation comments in source files has many benefits, in some circumstances it makes more sense to separate content from the source files, such as:

* When you include thorough code listings or numerous images that increase the
  size of your documentation and make source files difficult to manage
* When your source documentation comments focus on the implementation of your
  code, and aren't appropriate for external documentation

To add an extension file to your documentation catalog, create a file within the
documentation catalog, then modify the first line of the file to identify the
symbol that the file relates to using a symbol link in a level 1 header. For
more information on linking to symbols, see
<doc:linking-to-symbols-and-other-content>.

DocC ignores file names of documentation extensions; you can choose any file
name you would like as long as it uses an `.md` extension. DocC determines the
URL path of source documentation from the symbol's name, type and parent type
among other things.

> Important: If DocC can't resolve the symbol link in the level 1 header of the
> extension file, it will raise a warning about the link and skip the rest of
> the content of that extension file.
>
> DocC resolves symbol links in extension file headers relative to the module.
> To create an extension file for a nested type or member symbol, start the
> symbol link with the name of the top-level symbol that contains the nested
> type or member symbol. You can optionally prefix the symbol link with the
> name of the module, but DocC does not require this prefix.

By default, the extension file's content adds to the symbol's existing source documentation comment. 
You can leave key information in the documentation comment---where it's available to people reading the source code---and use the extension file for longer documentation, code examples, images, and for organizing you documentation hierarchy. 
For example, to add a section about the sleeping habits of sloths to the `Sloth` type, the extension file contains the following:

```markdown
# ``Sloth``

## Sleeping Habits

Sloths sleep in trees by curling into a ball and hanging by their claws.
```

If the symbol's existing source documentation focuses on implementation and isn't appropriate for external documentation, you can completely replace the documentation comment's content with the extension file's content by adding a ``DocumentationExtension`` directive. 
For example, to replace the source documentation comments of the `Sloth` type in SlothCreator, the extension file contains the following:

```markdown
# ``Sloth``

@Metadata {
    @DocumentationExtension(mergeBehavior: override)
}

This overrides the in-source summary.

## Overview

This content overrides in-source content.
```

<doc:Metadata>.
