# Distributing Documentation to Other Developers

Share your documentation by hosting it on a web server.

## Overview

As soon as you create a Swift framework or package, DocC is ready to
generate structured documentation for the public types in your code base. Whether
you only have documentation comments in your source files, or you craft a full
learning experience that includes articles and tutorials, you can easily share the documentation in your code base with other
developers.

To share your documentation, you create a documentation archive, a
self-contained bundle that has everything you need, including:

- Compiled documentation from in-source comments, articles, tutorials, and
  resources
- A single-page web app that renders the documentation

Distributing your documentation involves the following steps:

1. Export your documentation using the `docc` command-line tool.
2. Share your documentation by hosting it on a website.

### Generate a Publishable Archive of Your Documentation

To create a documentation archive for a Swift package, use the [SwiftPM DocC
Plugin](https://swiftlang.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/)
or use Xcode's _Build Documentation_ command.

Alternatively, use the `docc` command-line tool directly, for example:

```shell 
docc convert MyNewPackage.docc \
  --fallback-display-name MyNewPackage \
  --fallback-bundle-identifier com.example.MyNewPackage \
  --fallback-bundle-version 1 \
  --additional-symbol-graph-dir .build \
  --output-dir MyNewPackage.doccarchive
```

#### Include Links to your Project's Sources

When publishing documentation to an audience that has access to your project's
sources; for example, with an open source project hosted on GitHub, consider configuring
DocC to automatically include links to the declarations of your project's symbols.

For example, in the following screenshot, the "ParsableCommand.swift" link
below the declaration navigates to the `ParsableCommand` declaration in the
project's GitHub repository.

![A DocC documentation page showing the title and declaration of a symbol
called ParsableCommand. Under the declaration, there is a link with a Swift
icon and the file name ParsableCommand.swift](link-to-source.png)

To configure DocC to generate links to your project's sources, use the source
service configuration flags like so:

**GitHub**
```bash
docc convert […] \
    --source-service github \
    --source-service-base-url https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/blob/<branch> \
    --checkout-path <absolute path to local checkout>
```

**GitLab**
```bash
docc convert […] \
    --source-service gitlab \
    --source-service-base-url https://gitlab.com/<org>/<repo>/-/tree/<branch> \
    --checkout-path <absolute path to local checkout>
```

**BitBucket**
```bash
docc convert […] \
    --source-service bitbucket \
    --source-service-base-url https://bitbucket.org/<org>/<repo>/src/<branch> \
    --checkout-path <absolute path to local checkout>
```

> Note: The option `--checkout-path` expects an absolute path to where the package 
is checked out, not a relative path.

These arguments can also be provided to `swift package generate-documentation`
if you're using the SwiftPM DocC Plugin or via the `OTHER_DOCC_FLAGS` build
setting when building in Xcode.

### Send a Documentation Archive Directly to Developers

Because a documentation archive is a self-contained bundle, you can easily
share it with other developers. For example, you can send it by email just like
a regular document, include it with a binary distribution of your framework or
package, or make it downloadable from a website.

To remove an imported documentation archive, place your pointer over the item
to display the More button, and then choose Remove.

### Host a Documentation Archive on Your Website

When DocC exports a documentation archive, it includes a single-page web app
in the bundle. This web app renders the documentation content as HTML, letting
you host the documentation archive on a web server.

For reference documentation and articles, the web app uses a URL path that
begins with `/documentation`. For tutorials, the URL path begins with
`/tutorials`. For example, if a project contains a protocol
with the name `MyNewProtocol`, the URL to view the `MyNewPackage`
documentation might resemble the following:

```
https://www.example.com/documentation/MyNewPackage/MyNewProtocol
```

#### Host a Documentation Archive with a File Server

You can host documentation archives you create with DocC from the Swift 5.7 
toolchain and later using a regular file server. By default, the server hosts 
the documentation at the root of the website, like the "MyNewPackage" example 
above. To host the documentation at a specific subpath, pass a custom hosting 
base path for the `--hosting-base-path` option when you build the documentation
archive. 

```shell 
docc convert MyNewPackage.docc \
  --additional-symbol-graph-dir .build \
  --output-dir MyNewPackage.doccarchive \
  --hosting-base-path MyProject/Base/Path 
```

DocC adds the provided hosting base path before the path of each documentation
page. For example, the URL to view for `MyNewProtocol` protocol in the 
`MyNewPackage` documentation might resemble the following:

```
https://www.example.com/MyProject/Base/Path/documentation/MyNewPackage/MyNewProtocol
                        ╰────────┬────────╯
                       your custom base path
```

You can also configure the base path path via the `--hosting-base-path` option
when [building documentation using the SwiftPM DocC Plugin][plugin-docs] or via
the `DOCC_HOSTING_BASE_PATH` build setting when building documentation in Xcode.

#### Host a Documentation Archive Using Custom Routing

A file server is the recommended solution to host your documentation. But, if 
you need more control over how the server hosts your content, you can configure
the request routing of your web server so it responds to documentation requests 
with the data and assets within the documentation archive.

> Note: The following sections use Apache as an example. Other web server
  installations have similar mechanisms. Consult your server's documentation
  for details about performing similar configurations.

To host a documentation archive on your website, do the following:

1. Copy the documentation archive to the directory that your web server uses to
   serve files. In this example, the documentation archive is
   `MyNewPackage.doccarchive`.
2. Add a rule on the server to rewrite incoming URLs that begin with
   `/documentation` or `/tutorial` to `MyNewPackage.doccarchive/index.html`.
3. Add another rule for incoming requests to support bundled resources in the
   documentation archive, such as CSS files and image assets.

The following example `.htaccess` file defines rules suitable for use with Apache:

```shell
# Enable custom routing.
RewriteEngine On

# Route documentation and tutorial pages.
RewriteRule ^(documentation|tutorials)\/.*$ MyNewPackage.doccarchive/index.html [L]

# Route files and data for the documentation archive.
#
# If the file path doesn't exist in the website's root ...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# ... route the request to that file path with the documentation archive.
RewriteRule .* MyNewPackage.doccarchive/$0 [L]
```

With these rules in place, the web server provides access to the contents of
the documentation archive. 

After configuring your web server to host a documentation archive, keep it up
to date by using a continuous integration workflow that builds the
documentation archive using `docc`, and copies the resulting
`.doccarchive` to your web server.
