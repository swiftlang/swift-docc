/// A type that resolves references to documentation from other sources.
///
/// Use this protocol to integrate documentation content from other sources. Your implementation needs to be able to:
///  * Resolve references for the bundle identifier for which it's registered.
///  * Create entities for the references it was able to resolve.
///
/// When the documentation context encounters a reference that can't be resolved locally, it checks whether an external documentation source is registered in
/// ``DocumentationContext/externalDocumentationSources`` for the bundle identifier of the unresolved reference. If there is, that source is asked to attempt to resolve the reference.
///
/// If the referenced documentation exists in the external source, the source returns a resolved reference to the context. Later, the context uses this resolved reference to ask the source
/// for the external entity with the documentation content for that reference. Because this content isn't part of the compiled catalog, it won't have its own page in the build output.
///
/// If the reference doesn't exist in the external source of documentation or if an error occurs while attempting to resolve the reference, the external source returns information about the error.
///
/// ## See Also
/// - ``DocumentationContext/externalDocumentationSources``
/// - ``GlobalExternalSymbolResolver``
/// - ``TopicReferenceResolutionResult``
