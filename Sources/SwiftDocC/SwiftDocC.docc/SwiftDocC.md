# ``SwiftDocC``

Combine code comments with markup prose to produce structured, semantic documentation.

## Overview

DocC comes with built-in support for several types of input files. You group these files by placing them in a folder with a `.docc` extension. This folder is called a documentation catalog, and can include these file types:
 
 - Lightweight markdown files that contain free-form articles or additional symbol documentation, with an `.md` extension.
 - Tutorial files that include dynamic learning content, with a `.tutorial` extension.
 - Asset files like images, videos, and archived projects for download, with known extensions like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.mov`, and `.zip`.
 - Symbol-graph files that describe the symbols of your API, with an `.symbols.json` extension.
 - An `Info.plist` file with optional metadata about the documentation.
 - A `theme-settings.json` with theming customizations for the rendered output.

SwiftDocC provides the APIs you use to discover documentation inputs, load catalog content, parse the symbol-graph meta-information, extract symbol documentation, and pair that symbol documentation with external file content. 
DocC represents the compiled documentation in an in-memory model that you can further convert in a persistable representation for writing to disk.
