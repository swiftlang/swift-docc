/**
 A focused semantic analysis of a `BlockDirective`, recording problems and producing a result.
 
 A semantic analysis should check focus on the smallest meaningful aspect of the incoming `BlockDirective`.
 This eases testing and helps prevent a tangle of dependencies and side effects. For every analysis, there
 should be some number of tests for its robustness.
 
 For example, if an argument is required and is expected to be an integer, a semantic analysis
 would check only that argument, attempt to convert it to an integer, and return it as the result.
 
 > Important: A ``SemanticAnalysis`` should not mutate outside state or directly depend on the results
 of another analysis. This prevents runaway performance problems and strange bugs.
 > It also makes it more amenable to parallelization should the need arise.

     - returns: A result of the analysis if required, such as a validated parameter or subsection.
