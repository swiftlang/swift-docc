/// A directive that configures an alternate language representation of a symbol.
///
/// An API that can be called from more than one source language has more than one language representation.
///
/// Whenever possible, prefer to define alternative language representations for a symbol by using in-source annotations
/// such as the `@objc` and `@_objcImplementation` attributes in Swift,
/// or the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro in Objective C.
///
/// If your source language doesnâ€™t have a mechanism for specifying alternate representations or if your intended alternate representation isn't compatible with those attributes,
/// you can use the `@AlternateRepresentation` directive to specify another symbol that should be considered an alternate representation of the documented symbol.
///
/// ```md
/// @Metadata {
///     @AlternateRepresentation(MyApp/MyClass/property)
/// }
/// ```
/// If you prefer, you can wrap the symbol link in a set of double backticks (\`\`), or use any other supported syntax for linking to symbols.
/// For more information about linking to symbols, see <doc:linking-to-symbols-and-other-content>.
///
/// This provides a hint to the renderer as to the alternate language representations for the current symbol.
/// The renderer may use this hint to provide a link to these alternate symbols.
/// For example, Swift-DocC-Render shows a toggle between supported languages, where switching to a different language representation will redirect to the documentation for the configured alternate symbol.
///
/// ### Special considerations
///
/// Links containing a colon (`:`) must be wrapped in quotes:
/// ```md
/// @Metadata {
///     @AlternateRepresentation("doc://com.example/documentation/MyClass/property")
///     @AlternateRepresentation("MyClass/myFunc(_:_:)")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The `@AlternateRepresentation` directive only specifies an alternate language representation in one direction.
/// To define a two-way relationship, add an `@AlternateRepresentation` directive, linking to this symbol, to the other symbol as well.
///
/// You can only configure custom alternate language representations for languages that the documented symbol doesn't already have a language representation for,
/// either from in-source annotations or from a previous `@AlternateRepresentation` directive.
