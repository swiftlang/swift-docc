/// A resolver that attempts to resolve local references to content that wasn't included in the catalog or symbol input.
///
/// The ``ConvertService`` builds documentation for a single page, which doesn't have to be a top-level page. If this page's content contains references to other local
/// symbols, pages, or assets that aren't included in the ``ConvertRequest``, this fallback resolver resolves those references to on-demand fill in the missing local content.
///
/// For example, when building documentation for `someFunction()` that's a member of `SomeClass` in `SomeModule`, the ``ConvertService`` can pass a
/// "partial" symbol graph file that only contains `someFunction()` and its relationships but not `SomeClass` or any other symbols. If `someFunction()` has a local
/// documentation link or symbol link to another symbol or page, DocC won't be able to find the page that the link refers to and will ask the fallback resolver to attempt to resolve it.
///
/// > Note: The ``ConvertService`` only renders the one page that it provided inputs for. Because of this, the content that this fallback resolver returns is considered
/// "external" content, even if it represents pages that would be "local" if the full project was built together.
