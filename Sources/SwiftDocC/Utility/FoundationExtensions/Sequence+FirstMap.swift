    /// let html = identifiers.mapFirst(where: { id in
    ///   guard let result = lookupPageWithID(id).fetchMarkup() else {
    ///     return nil
    ///   }

    /// })
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameter predicate: A mapping closure that accepts an element of this sequence as its parameter and returns a transformed value or `nil`.
    /// - Throws: Any error that's raised by the mapping closure.
    /// - Returns: The first mapped, non-nil value, or `nil` if the mapping closure returned `nil` for every value in the sequence.
